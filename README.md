### Project Demo Link: [Flip a Card](https://jcsmiley-flip-a-card.netlify.app/)

### Purpose:

A React web game where the user race against time to match unturned cards.

### Motivation:

The goal was to build a capstone project along side my students in the Launch Code tech boot-camp. This meant:
1. Pre-planning with hi-fi wire-framing using Adobe XD
2. Using Trello for task management
3. Creating user stories to help plan tasks and determing what into the MVP, alpha, and beta app
4. Accessibility enhancements (Using images, colors, and etc. to show a choice, keyboard navigation and playability, HTML semantics, includes roles and aria-labels)
5. Intentional breaking the code into smaller components.
